# Data Structures in Java
### Overview
This repository showcases a Java implementation of fundamental data structures: a linked list and a binary tree. The code offers comprehensive functionality for insertion, deletion, and search operations in both data structures. Moreover, the binary tree implementation features a sophisticated balancing algorithm to optimize its structure. This project serves as an interactive demonstration of essential data structure concepts and their practical applications. It aims to enhance your understanding and proficiency in implementing and utilizing data structures efficiently in Java.
